      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Serbia. It's my new, little-known home. It is not to be confused with freezing Siberia-
        in Russia. This rich country is in the heart of the Balkans, in Eastern Europe. 
        My website will allow people to see the beauty, adventure, and peace that lives here-
         as well as help them know where it is.</p>

     <p>This is a place where home is a culture, not just a place to visit on the holidays. 
         The people are warm, the food wonderful, and the city so alive that it feels like Disney 
         Land. Are you ready for a new adventure? Come check out my site and learn more.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is mostly Americans. I am from the US and when I met my wife I 
        could not picture where Serbia was on the map. Same with almost all Americans who do not 
    follow tennis (Novak Djokovic fans). Most of the target audience will be those who don't know how great 
    it is here for a place to vacation- just like Croatia, Greece, Austria, or Italy, which are
    the neighboring countries. I target all those who are interested in travel from ages 14-90.</p>  <!-- change this -->

People will come to my site to learn about Serbia and why it is a wonderful place to visit. I have lived here since February 2022 and have experiences to share. 
<br>
Serbia is in the heart of the Balkans; east of Italy and east of the Adriatic Sea.  
<br>
I live in northern Serbia, on the banks of the Sava River, in Sremska Mitrovica. The city is built atop one of the ancient Roman Empire capitals.  
<br>
It is easy to see why they had a capital here. There are mountains, rivers, lush forests, and beautiful plains with some of the most fertile land and generous rain. Pictures will do more justice to the place than anything else, so here:

<p>
For those who have been to Europe before, the charm extends here to Serbia, offering new amenities, established architecture, and clean streets.

      <h3>Culture</h3>
      <p>

Serbia is filled with friendly people. Many people speak English well, especially the younger generations. When people do speak English, they are very willing to speak it to make it easier on the guest. When a guest is attempting to speak Serbian, efforts are graciously applauded. The people here appreciate every effort and are warm and receptive. 
<br>
Serbia is alive! There are people of all ages out walking and riding bicycles outside all the time. It makes it an extremely comfortable place to live or visit. No matter where you go, you are not alone. And it is very safe here. I often compare it to a European Disney Land. There are gelato places everywhere, charming cafés with outdoor dining areas. 
<br>
People here are big partiers. People of all ages love to gather in outdoor cafes and homes to share meals often. There are also parties every weekend and here in the city I live in, Sremska Mitrovica. One thing it is known for in the summer is the wonderful sandy beach that is here on the river. People from all over come to visit and enjoy the beach. There are plenty of cafes, bars, sunbathing areas, sandy beach space, and picnic areas, which are extremely family friendly. 
<br>
Besides the locations being family friendly, the people here are as well. Recently, I had my hands full with my baby, so the store clerk took my ‘order’ of what I wanted and packed the food items for me and went outside without asking and started putting stuff away in my bike basket, so that I would not have to struggle by myself.  
<br>
When out, people are genuinely happy to see my baby as well and are always kind and helpful. Whenever my baby says, “Hi!” which she does often, people respond as if they are family. 
<br>
Also important to mention is that people here are relaxed. People are not on edge, trying to work too much and be with family too little. People are extremely balanced. Even just by visiting you will feel happier after feeling that influence in small ways like not being rushed out of a busy café because it is expected that a guest will take their time to enjoy the meal. 
<br>
Lastly, the people here do good to those around them because it is just what you do. Often, when I was extended kindness, especially in ways that was uncommon in the US, people respond by saying, ‘oh no problem, it’s just what you do,’ and it really is! People are extremely warm and friendly here.

      <h3>Food</h3>
      <p>
        Serbia is well stocked with wonderful produce as well. There are open markets, and small shops all around that sell seasonal fresh produce. Part of the reason the food is so good here is because no GMO products are allowed int the country. Impossible to forget also, is that Serbians are meat masters. MASTERS. There are cured, smoked, and grilled meats with wonderful food creations that will make anyone happy. If meat is not on the menu for someone, the fresh fruit and veggies are endless. 
<br>
Food here is not ever something that is done 'fast' (in a fast-food manner). Of course, McDonald's and other chains can certainly be found in malls, but when you come to visit, please refrain from participating in common fast food and enjoy the local cuisine. Everything is fresh, so it is to be enjoyed. Here they do prepare fresh food quickly, though. People love their food, and it is no surprise that there are extremely talented chefs in so many restaurants. It is all so good I wish I could take it everywhere with me in a suitcase.
