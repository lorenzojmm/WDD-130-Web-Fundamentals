                <h3>Culture</h3>
                    <p>
                        Serbia is filled with friendly people. Many people speak English well, especially the younger generations. When people do speak English, they are very willing to speak it to make it easier on the guest. When a guest is attempting to speak Serbian, efforts are graciously applauded. The people here appreciate every effort and are warm and receptive. <br>
                        <br>
                        Serbia is alive! There are people of all ages out walking and riding bicycles outside all the time. It makes it an extremely comfortable place to live or visit. No matter where you go, you are not alone. And it is very safe here. I often compare it to a European Disney Land. There are gelato places everywhere, charming cafés with outdoor dining areas.<br> 
                        <br>
                        People here are big partiers. People of all ages love to gather in outdoor cafes and homes to share meals often. There are also parties every weekend and here in the city I live in, Sremska Mitrovica. One thing it is known for in the summer is the wonderful sandy beach that is here on the river. People from all over come to visit and enjoy the beach. There are plenty of cafes, bars, sunbathing areas, sandy beach space, and picnic areas, which are extremely family friendly.<br> 
                        <br>
                        Besides the locations being family friendly, the people here are as well. Recently, I had my hands full with my baby, so the store clerk took my ‘order’ of what I wanted and packed the food items for me and went outside without asking and started putting stuff away in my bike basket, so that I would not have to struggle by myself.  <br>
                        <br>
                        When out, people are genuinely happy to see my baby as well and are always kind and helpful. Whenever my baby says, “Hi!” which she does often, people respond as if they are family. <br>
                        <br>
                        Also important to mention is that people here are relaxed. People are not on edge, trying to work too much and be with family too little. People are extremely balanced. Even just by visiting you will feel happier after feeling that influence in small ways like not being rushed out of a busy café because it is expected that a guest will take their time to enjoy the meal. <br>
                        <br>
                        Lastly, the people here do good to those around them because it is just what you do. Often, when I was extended kindness, especially in ways that was uncommon in the US, people respond by saying, ‘oh no problem, it’s just what you do,’ and it really is! People are extremely warm and friendly here.
