        <p><em>Information about your personal site that might be helpful to know as you start the site-plan.

            <ol>
                <li>             The personal site must consist of a home page and at least 2 child pages.
                </li>
                <li>            The Web site must be hosted on the web.
                </li>
                <li>             Each page of your Web site must satisfy the following requirements:
                </li>
                <li>             Significant textual content consisting of appropriate content for your audience so that they can understand the meaning and message of this site.
                </li>
                <li>             At least one image that relates to the content of the page.
                </li>
                <li>            Working links to your two child pages.
                </li>
                <li>            Be laid out and styled according to your site plan wireframes.

        Just as we did for the rafting site, before we build our personal
        (final) project, we need to do some planning. We started this project
        by preparing our purpose with the elevator pitch. This week we will begin a Site plan for the
        personal site we want to build that is very similar to the one we
        prepared for the rafting site.

      <h2>Activity Directions</h2>
      <ol class="bigSteps">
        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Create a new folder for your new site</h3>
          <p>
            Let's start by adding a folder to the 'wdd130' folder. You can do this in file management or on Visual Studio Code.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Give this folder a name and remember this will be a part of the URL (web address), so keep it short, simple, and
            professional. The folder name should be all lowercase with no spaces. The name should also have something to do with the topic of your personal site. This folder will be at the same level as our 'wwr' folder and will contain the new personal site project.
          </p>
          
        </li>
     
        <li>
          <h3>Add Site Plan Files</h3>
          <p>
            Add a file to your new folder called <kbd>site-plan.html</kbd>. The example here shows the new folder called 'dress4success'. Yours will, of course, have a different named folder. You also don't need a README.md file like is shown in the images if you don't choose to have one.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w07/new_file.png"
              alt="new site-plan.html file screen shot">
          </figure>
          <p>Go to: <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/site-plan-templates/site-plan-personal.html"
              target="_blank">Site Plan Template</a>, right-click on the page, and view the source code. (On Chrome it's
            the pop-up menu option 'View Page Source'.)</p>
          <p>
            Copy <strong>all</strong> the HTML code. You can use Cmd+A or Ctrl+A to select it all quickly, then copy it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paste the code into your <kbd>site-plan.html</kbd> page in VSCode and save the file.</p>
          <p>Create a new 'styles' folder. And create a <kbd>site-plan.css</kbd> file inside that folder.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w07/new_css.png"
              alt="new style folder and file screen shot">
          </figure>
          <p>Go to: <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/site-plan-templates/styles/site-plan.css"
              target="_blank">Site Plan CSS</a> and copy <strong>all</strong> the code.</p>
          <p>Paste the code into the <kbd>site-plan.css</kbd> file in VSCode and save it.</p>
          <p>
            As you look at the new site plan template, you will notice it is very
            similar to the last one. It does have a new section, however...Content.
            For the rafting site, you were provided with content, but you will need to
            generate all of the content (text and media) for your site.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will also be required to create three wireframes. One for each
            page of your site. Creating wireframes will be covered at a later time.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will have some activities designed to help you complete your site
            plan...but much of it you will need to do on your own. The completed
            site plan for your personal site is due at the end of
            <strong>Week 9</strong>. This gives you three weeks to complete it.
            <strong>Don't wait until the beginning of Week 9 to start!!</strong>

          <h3>Purpose and Audience</h3>
          <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>Serbia. It's my new, little-known home. It is not to be confused with freezing Siberia-
               in Russia. This rich country is in the heart of the Balkans, in Eastern Europe. 
               My website will allow people to see the beauty, adventure, and peace that lives here-
                as well as help them know where it is.</p>

            <p>This is a place where home is a culture, not just a place to visit on the holidays. 
                The people are warm, the food wonderful, and the city so alive that it feels like Disney 
                Land. Are you ready for a new adventure? Come check out my site and learn more.</p>
        <h4>Intended Audience</h4>
            <p>My intended audience is mostly Americans. I am from the US and when I met my wife I 
                could not picture where Serbia was on the map. Same with almost all Americans who do not 
            follow tennis (Novak Djokovic fans). It seems most of the target audience don't know how great 
            it is here for a place to vacation, just like Croatia, Greece, Austria, or Italy are- which are
            the neighboring countries. I target all those who are interested in travel from ages 14-90. </p>

          <p>
            Choose a color scheme and one or more fonts that you think will
            work well and enter the information into the plan's HTML and CSS.

            of the URL web address and hit enter to get it to open.
          </p>
          Something like: your-account.github.io/wwd130/personal-folder/site-plan.html

            Your site plan should then come up. Use that URL to submit.
