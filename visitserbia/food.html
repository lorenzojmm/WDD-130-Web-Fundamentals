                <p>
                    Serbia is well stocked with wonderful produce as well. There are open markets, and small shops all around that sell seasonal fresh produce. Part of the reason the food is so good here is because no GMO products are allowed int the country. Impossible to forget also, is that Serbians are meat masters. MASTERS. There are cured, smoked, and grilled meats with wonderful food creations that will make anyone happy. If meat is not on the menu for someone, the fresh fruit and veggies are endless. 
            <br>
            Food here is not ever something that is done 'fast' (in a fast-food manner). Of course, McDonald's and other chains can certainly be found in malls, but when you come to visit, please refrain from participating in common fast food and enjoy the local cuisine. Everything is fresh, so it is to be enjoyed. Here they do prepare fresh food quickly, though. People love their food, and it is no surprise that there are extremely talented chefs in so many restaurants. It is all so good I wish I could take it everywhere with me in a suitcase.
