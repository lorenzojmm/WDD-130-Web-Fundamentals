      <p>
        I am from Las Vegas. 
        I served a mission in Peru in 2014. 
        I got married in 2019. We had our first baby in 2021. 
        Most of my career has been in Customer service / Technical support. 
        Previously, I studied biology. I'm a big nature-lover. Plans change though. 
        So, to pursue a career that fits our lifestyle better 
        I decided to enroll in courses in pathway and switch degrees. Unrelated to the degree,
        now we live in Serbia and we are loving it.
        I will be graduating July 2023- with an Applied Technology Degree.
